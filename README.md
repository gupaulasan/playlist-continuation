# Automatic Playlist Continuation

This project aims to develop an automatic Spotify playlist continuation AI.

## Dataset

The dataset used in the project is the Million Playlist Dataset, it is available for download, at this <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge/dataset_files" target="_blank">link</a>

## Report

The report, available in the <a href="https://github.com/gupaulasan/playlist-continuation/blob/main/Report.pdf" target="_blank">Report.pdf</a> file contains a complete description of the work, it also contains an analysis of the results. The report was written in Portuguese, but all the findings can be read in the project's notebook.

## Important advice

The project was fully developed on Google Colab. Some cells use paths related to my personal Google Drive, it would be necessary to change these paths in order to make the notebook run locally.

Following GitHub's recommendation, no data was uploaded to the repo.
